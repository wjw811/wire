/**
 * Install Middleware
 *
 * This middleware adds a simple web installer to your Slim applications.
 * It will first look for a lock file, in case it doesn't exist will show 
 * the installer template. Once the form is submited it runs your own callback
 * and creates the lock file to avoid showing the install template again.
 *
 * The default template will display a form with some basic database fields,
 * such as database host, name or password. You can set your own template for
 * more control.
 *
 * To set an error in the installer form use the Flash's middleware flashNow.
